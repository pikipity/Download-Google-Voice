Download Google Voice
----------------------------

This program is used to download the google voice in the "Google Translation".

It can be used in Windows, Linux and Mac. For Mac and Linux, you can run this program by running "main.py". For Windows, there will be the "setup.exe" program to allow you set up this program easily.

But in Linux, I didn't test. Maybe there will be some problems. If you find some problems, please feel free to contect me.

Now, It only support "Chinese", "English" and "Japanese". For "Japanese", I didn't test in Windows. Maybe there will be some problems. If you find some problems, please feel free to contect me.

Have Fun. Thank you.
